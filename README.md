## BFS\_cells
Python program designed to draw a graph marked with '*'s (walls) and '.'s (paths) to the screen and detect if there is an open 'path'  
to an end point given a start point (both provided).

## Running BFS\_cells

The usage of the program is:

    python3 \*\*\*\*.py height width starty startx endy endx

height --height of graph (indexed 0 - height - 1)
width  --width of graph (indexed 0 - width - 1)
starty --starting y-coordinate of start point
startx --starting x-coordinate of start point
endy   --endpoint y-coordinate
endx   --endpoint x-coordinate
